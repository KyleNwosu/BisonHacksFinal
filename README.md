## Problem Statement
Black first generation students transitioning from high school to college often go through a lots of stress because of information and advice they couldnt get from their guardians and this take a toll from their mental health. 

## Insipration
The idea for MindMatters came from the fact that a large number of black students are first gen student and as such, they lack any parental guardian or figures to help them navigate the process from highschool to college. This in turn leads to stress about a number of things and subsequenlty these students may turn to other harmful sources for relief. The idea here is to prevent the stress from everr being introduced in the first place. 

## Solution -- What MindMatters does
Our solution is a conversational bot that aims to guide students through their transtion from high school to college so they dont worry about all of the finance knowledge, academic tips and career ideas all on their own. By using AI, we can customize a chatbot for each students whose sole puurpose is to provide assistance. The chatbot was highly trained to prevent it saying wrong information.
