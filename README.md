## Problem Statement
Black first-generation students transitioning from high school to college often go through a lot of stress because of information and advice they couldn't get from their guardians and this takes a toll on their mental health. 

## Insipration
The idea for MindMatters came from the fact that many black students are first-generation students and as such, they lack any parental guardian or figures to help them navigate the process from high school to college. This leads to stress about several things and subsequently, these students may turn to other harmful sources for relief. The idea here is to prevent the stress from ever being introduced in the first place. 

## Solution -- What MindMatters does
Our solution is a conversational bot that aims to guide students through their transition from high school to college so they don't worry about all of the finance knowledge, academic tips, and career ideas all on their own. By using AI, we can customize a chatbot for each student whose sole purpose is to assist. The chatbot was highly trained to prevent it from saying wrong information. 

## Challenges
1. Limited sources to train high-quality data.


## What's Next for MindMatter
